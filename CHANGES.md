# Gmail Digest Assistant - Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Urgency display now uses emojis: üü¢ Normal, üî¥ Urgent, ‚≠ê Important.
- Digest summary logic improved: Claude-style prompt, no subject/body labels, concise paragraph only.
- Subject is truncated to 200 characters if needed.
- Summaries strip links, images, and non-textual content.
- Digest formatting and inline button features iteratively improved for clarity and usability.
- **Robust summarization failover:** Now uses Anthropic API first, then local summarizer, then heuristic fallback. Digest indicates if a local or fallback summary was used.
- **Persistent OAuth:**  Tokens are now auto-refreshed with retry/back-off logic and
  saved with metadata to reduce unexpected re-authorisations.
- **/reauthorize command:**  New Telegram bot command that lets users force a fresh
  Google OAuth flow from chat if needed (e.g., after credential revocation).
- Path-independent design ‚Äì the assistant now runs correctly from **any** cloned directory (no hard-coded paths).
- Enhanced email forwarding ‚Äì HTML bodies and attachments are now preserved when forwarding messages.
- Fixed dependency conflict between **python-telegram-bot** 20.x and **httpx** by pinning compatible versions.
- Fixed dependency conflict between **anthropic** and **httpx** by constraining anthropic < 0.25.0.
- Made **pysqlcipher3** optional via Poetry *encrypted_storage* extra to avoid build failures on systems without SQLCipher headers.
- Fixed Pydantic v2 `BaseSettings` import issue ‚Äì now imported from **pydantic_settings**.
- Added **email-validator** runtime dependency required for Pydantic‚Äôs `EmailStr` validation.
- Added proper configuration validation to prevent using **PLACEHOLDER** bot tokens at runtime.
- Fixed JSON serialization of `Path` objects in the setup wizard (no more ‚ÄúPath is not JSON serialisable‚Äù error).
- Fixed `SecretStr` handling in the setup wizard by using direct assignment (compatible with Pydantic v2).
- Updated documentation (README / README-v2) for the refined setup flow and improved first-run user experience.
- Fixed configuration loading issues ‚Äì settings are now reliably loaded from `config/.env.json`.
- Fixed **‚ÄúUpdater still running‚Äù** error in Telegram bot startup ‚Äì bot now shuts down and restarts cleanly using PTB `application.idle()`.
- Further improved path handling and startup error messages, fully supporting execution from **any** working directory.
- Switched bot lifecycle to PTB **`run_polling()`** for a cleaner single-call startup/shutdown sequence.
- Introduced **`run_async_safely()`** utility to integrate asyncio coroutines with Typer CLI while avoiding ‚Äúevent loop already running‚Äù runtime errors.
- Added a full **TDD test-suite** (pytest-asyncio + unittest.mock) covering bot lifecycle, configuration loading, and error handling ‚Äì all current tests pass.
