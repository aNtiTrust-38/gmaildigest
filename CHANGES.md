# Gmail Digest Assistant - Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Urgency display now uses emojis: üü¢ Normal, üî¥ Urgent, ‚≠ê Important.
- Digest summary logic improved: Claude-style prompt, no subject/body labels, concise paragraph only.
- Subject is truncated to 200 characters if needed.
- Summaries strip links, images, and non-textual content.
- Digest formatting and inline button features iteratively improved for clarity and usability.
- **Robust summarization failover:** Now uses Anthropic API first, then local summarizer, then heuristic fallback. Digest indicates if a local or fallback summary was used.
- **Persistent OAuth:**  Tokens are now auto-refreshed with retry/back-off logic and
  saved with metadata to reduce unexpected re-authorisations.
- **/reauthorize command:**  New Telegram bot command that lets users force a fresh
  Google OAuth flow from chat if needed (e.g., after credential revocation).
- Path-independent design ‚Äì the assistant now runs correctly from **any** cloned directory (no hard-coded paths).
- Enhanced email forwarding ‚Äì HTML bodies and attachments are now preserved when forwarding messages.
- Fixed dependency conflict between **python-telegram-bot** 20.x and **httpx** by pinning compatible versions.
- Fixed dependency conflict between **anthropic** and **httpx** by constraining anthropic < 0.25.0.
- Made **pysqlcipher3** optional via Poetry *encrypted_storage* extra to avoid build failures on systems without SQLCipher headers.
- Fixed Pydantic v2 `BaseSettings` import issue ‚Äì now imported from **pydantic_settings**.
- Added **email-validator** runtime dependency required for Pydantic‚Äôs `EmailStr` validation.
