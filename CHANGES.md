# Gmail Digest Assistant - Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Urgency display now uses emojis: üü¢ Normal, üî¥ Urgent, ‚≠ê Important.
- Digest summary logic improved: Claude-style prompt, no subject/body labels, concise paragraph only.
- Subject is truncated to 200 characters if needed.
- Summaries strip links, images, and non-textual content.
- Digest formatting and inline button features iteratively improved for clarity and usability.
- **Robust summarization failover:** Now uses Anthropic API first, then local summarizer, then heuristic fallback. Digest indicates if a local or fallback summary was used.
- **Persistent OAuth:**  Tokens are now auto-refreshed with retry/back-off logic and
  saved with metadata to reduce unexpected re-authorisations.
- **/reauthorize command:**  New Telegram bot command that lets users force a fresh
  Google OAuth flow from chat if needed (e.g., after credential revocation).
